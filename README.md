# My Emojis

This was a Scrimba project that I added on to with customizations. The original called for us to build an application that would let the user paste or type in an emoji into a text field and the application would rendedr it in a larger font at the top of the screen. Buttons let the emoji be added to the beginning or the end of the list of rendered emojis.

The input field accepted any string character, so visitors were left to their own devices to find an emoji and paste it into the input to render it.

Original design from Scrimba: [here](https://github.com/vishalicious213/my-emojis/blob/main/scrimba-version.jpg)

My customizations allowed visitors to pick emojis from a drop-down list to add to the start or end of an array and have them render onscreen. The emoji's size can be selected (small, medium, large) and the selected size is highlighted and remains active for more emojis until a new size is chosen.
